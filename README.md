The screenshot shows an evaluation assignment for a Front End Intern position. The task is to recreate a design using Tailwind CSS, focusing on the following requirements:

Code Structure: All code must be placed inside a div with the ID assignment.
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS must be used for styling the assignment.
Use of Icons: You need to include icons for each service box. Assignments without icons will not be evaluated. (You can reuse the same icon if necessary.)
Mouse Hover Animation: On hovering over the box, the box should rotate 360 degrees using a JS animation library (preferably a simple one).
Github Pages Deployment: Once completed, the project should be hosted on Github Pages, and the URL should be shared.
